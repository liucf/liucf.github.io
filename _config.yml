          Long-term project. A video/picture membership sales website developed using the Laravel framework (memberships $19.9 per month, unlimited viewing of all content on the website), produced for American companies, operated and servers are in the United States, and independently implements all front and back functions.

          Discuss the requirements with the person in charge of the American company. They are responsible for providing the design (PSD) files, and I am responsible for the program design. From the original pure PHP version, to the later use of the Codeigniter framework, now the Laravel framework is used. Many versions have been iterated. The website is now operating stably. Last month, the number of visits was 135K, which is able to maintain a stable income.

          The online data storage system (member fee system) developed using the Laravel framework is produced for American companies, and the operations and servers are all located in the United States. I did all the front and back functions independently. After the system went online, the operation effect was not good, but the front-end and back-end functions have been completed, including the integration of Stripe in the payment system.

          WeChat Mini Program developed for a Japanese company. The main function is to put the lottery products on the shelves, including rich functions such as membership level, referral mechanism, lottery rules, data analysis and so on. Customers provide requirements, and I am responsible for the design and development of the front and back ends. Zeplin was used for the design of the applet, and the native development language of WeChat was used for development. The back-end management system and API use Laravel framework and Nova. Now the system has just been completed and launched, the back-end address is https://ibc168.net/, and you can find it by searching in the mini program WeChat.
